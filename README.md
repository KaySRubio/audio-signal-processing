# Audio Signal Processing Skills Practice
## Goal
Practice skills learned in training for low-level and high-level audio signal processing tasks. Audio sources include human speech, animal sounds, ultrasound, and infrasound.

## Low-Level Audio Signal Processing Tasks
-	Visualize waveforms
-	Extract and visualize time-domain features: amplitude envelope, root mean square energy, zero-crossing rate
-	Apply Short-Time Fourier Transform and visualize spectrograms
-	Compare frame lengths to optimize frequency-time resolution for different types of sound
-	Compare using linear, log, and Mel scales for frequency for different types of sound
-	Extract MFCCS and visualize change over time
-	Extract and graph other frequency-domain features like spectral centroid and bandwidth

## High-Level Audio Signal Processing Tasks
-	Background noise removal
-	Voice Activity Detection
- Speaker diarization
-	Speech recognition
-	Labeling spectrograms
-	Accent analysis
-	Mood analysis

## Audio samples used
-	Human: conversation, singing, party noise
- Audible animal vocals: duck quacking, chicken egg song, sperm whale clicks
-	Infrasonic animal vocals: elephant rumbles
-	Ultrasonic animal vocals: bat echolocation, dolphin clicks/whistles (partially audible)
